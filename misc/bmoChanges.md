  3. Entitlement object check move to interceptor
  4. date format move to joda and util
  5. JSP practise
  6. more use of @RequestParam

- 1. use Restful call to  JasperServer rather than use HTTPclient library
  2. avoid websphere depencency completly
  3. make war or jar (bundled JAR) as deployment artifact rather than EAR
  4. create another Jenkin Job to deploy in DEV-webshpere

  7. Writing Junit test at least at controller level
  8. constant util for all String accross project
  9. java file with minimum no. line.
  10. what are the services/built-in portlets has been used from WPS.
