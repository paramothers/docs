# Linting Tools

**ESLint**


ESLint is the most recent out of the four. It was designed to be easily extensible, comes with a large number of custom rules, and itâ€™s easy to install more in the form of plugins. It gives concise output, but includes the rule name by default so you always know which rules are causing the error messages.

ESLint documentation can be a bit hit or miss. The rules list is easy to follow and is grouped into logical categories, but the configuration instructions are a little confusing in places. It does, however, offer links to editor integration, plugins and examples all in a single location
