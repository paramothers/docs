## Object
 it is top most built in object , like in java. any of others objects are child to this one. 
 instance's property or behavior can be accessed by either dot notation or bracket notation.
 it is un-ordered collection

## Array
it is ordered collection.
it is subclass to Object.

## String
it should be sub type of Array. (i believe)
