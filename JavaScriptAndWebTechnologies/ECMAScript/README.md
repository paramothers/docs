Creater of ECMAScript is ** Brendan Eich**, he worked for Netscape

EMCAScript is offical name of JavaScript. First it was called "mocha", then "LiveScript" . Finallly as "JavaScript"

Two more EMCAScript impletation are JScript and ActionScript


Current version is EMCAScript 5. but 6 in progress.

It is **mixture **of Both "Functional Programming" and "Object oriented Programming". that is both Function and Objects are play major role in this language.

Object are passed by reference.

JavaScript library usually delivered as \*.js file.



## draw back of ECMAScript was earlier.

1. Till version 3 does not exception handling. so many times is goes off silently.

2. it wont throw any exception

3. not support block-scoped variables \/ modules. \/ subclassing

4. DOM manipulation API,  gave bad impression about javascript, since its behave differetly across browsers


### Some of Java Script Library

1. Underscore.js, provide functional programming

2. Protype.js,

3. io.js
