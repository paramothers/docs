Creater of ECMAScript is ** Brendan Eich**, he worked for Netscape

EMCAScript is offical name of JavaScript.
Current version is EMCAScript 5. but 6 in progress.

It is **mixture **of Both "Functional Programming" and "Object oriented Programming"

Object are passed by reference.

##   draw back of ECMAScript was earlier.

1. Till version 3 does not exception handling. so many times is goes off silently.

2. it wont throw any exception

3. not support block-scoped variables \/ modules. \/ subclassing

4. DOM manipulation API,  gave bad impression about javascript, since its behave differetly across browsers
