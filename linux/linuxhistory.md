The Linux kernel runs on a highly diverse range of computer architectures: in the hand-held ARM-based iPAQ and the mainframe IBM System z9, System z10; in devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers.\[60\] Specialized distributions exist for less mainstream architectures. The ELKS kernel fork can run on Intel 8086 or Intel 80286 16-bit microprocessors, while the µClinux kernel fork may run on systems without a memory management unit. The kernel also runs on architectures that were only ever intended to use a manufacturer-created operating system, such as Macintosh computers (with both PowerPC and Intel processors), PDAs, video game consoles, portable music players, and mobile phones. |                    |

| Vi    | it is available in all unix. Like notepad in windows. So get familiar, even we use eclipse for development |
|       | it is editor within terminal window itself                                                                 |
|       | i think, it is best to use only for some configuration changes or small changes in programme.              |
|       | for application development use some other Emacs / eclipse editor ( my idea )                              |
|       | A number of enhanced versions of Vi exist, including nvi, vim, vile, and elvis                             |
