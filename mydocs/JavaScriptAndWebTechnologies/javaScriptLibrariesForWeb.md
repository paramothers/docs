### Minimum tool to be used for best practice

1. Gulp

2. Eslint

3. Node & Npm


### Minimum step can be followed for creating javascript project

1. Create a project root folder

2. Create a  npm project inside of root

3. install or configure gulp
4. install or configure eslint
5. create folder for web client files, if need

### Factor - 1

Creater of ECMAScript is ** Brendan Eich**, he worked for Netscape
EMCAScript is offical name of JavaScript. First it was called "mocha", then "LiveScript" . Finallly as "JavaScript"
Two more EMCAScript **impletation are JScript and ActionScript**
Current version is EMCAScript 7\(as on Sep,2016\).
Object are passed by reference.
JavaScript library usually delivered as single and minified \*.js file.
being a dynamic and loosely-typed language, is especially prone to developer error

**Either we do JavaScript progamming for Browser or Node.js**

### Subset of javascript

1. Objective-J
2. CoffeScript
3. TypeScript

### JavaScript Nature

1. dynamic
2. dynamic typed
3. It is mixture of Both "Functional Programming" and "Object oriented Programming". that is both Function and Objects are play major role in this language.
4. it is deployable as **Source**
5. First class function, Closure, prototypes, object literal, array literal

## draw back of ECMAScript was earlier.

1. Till version 3 does not exception handling. so many times is goes off silently.
2. it wont throw any exception
3. not support block-scoped variables \/ modules. \/ subclassing
4. DOM manipulation API,  gave bad impression about javascript, since its behave differetly across browsers

5. it is part of Web Platform \(DOM API, HTML** 5 API**\)


### Syntaic Sugar or source code improvement

1. Short-circut from C-language
2. function paramteter with default values
3. conditional invocation of methods
4. arrow function \(i.e Shorter function\)
5. new syntax for method defintion within object literal
6. variable length of argument \(we call them as resst operator in javaScript.. ES6\)

### Web UI

1. Html 5
2. CSS 3

### CSS Related Frameworks

1. SASS, for faster css development, ruby language based tool
2. Bootstrap, set of predefined class definitions, from twitter
3. \[LESS\]
4. \[stylus\]
5. 

### JavaScript UI Frameworks for faster web-client development

1. AngularJS 
2. ExtJS
3. JQuery
4. Backbone.JS \(MVC  framework\)
5. GWT, DWR,
6. Yahoo API \/ Dojo Toolkit

### Domain Object

JSON
\[CSON\] \( CoffeScript Object Notation\)

### Java Script Linting tools

1. ESLint \( it also has feature of  JSCS as merged into \). it is latest tool
2. JSCS - for javascript code sytle checker \(like checkstyle in java\)4. 
3. JsHint - for javaScript, it is came after JSLint
4. JsLint - for javaScript, it is oldest tool - Avoid usage of this tool

### JavaScript Unit testing framework

1. Mocha with **Chai** for assertion and **Sinon** for double check
2. Jasmine

### Javascript Minification

1. UglifyJs
2. YUICompressor
3. Closure Compiler

  ### JavaScript-Backend Communication

4. AJAX

5. Commet

  ### JavaScript- Build-workflow

6. Gulp

7. \[Grunt\]

8. ### JavaScript Scaffolding tool

9. Yo \(it is like set of archeType used in Mavan project creation\)


### JavaScript package\/dependency manager

1. Bower \(for client UI library depencency\)
2. Browserify
3. Npm

  ### JavaScript Runtime

4. v8-NodeJS

5. Browsers

6. mozilla' SpiderMonkey


### Node js for Desktop application development

1. Electron
2. Node-Webkit \(NW\)

### JavaScript Module Frameworks

1. Requrire.js, Browser based module system.
2. CommonJS, Server based module system, it is conceived by Node.js

  ### Javascript Documentation

3. JSDoc

  ### JavaScript - Abstraction programming - translated into javascript

4. CoffeScript, it is like GWT programming in Java-translate-to-html and Javascript

5. TypeScript - from microsoft


### Some of Java Script Library

1. Underscore.js, provide functional programming
2. Protype.js,
3. io.js, Now it is merged with node.js on node.js v4
