======
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 + first release in April 2008 ,it is also from apache, it is JVM based build tool                                                                                                                                                                                   
 + Groovy used as build script , Gradle is based on DSL rather than xml file like ant or maven                                                                                                                                                                       
 + it built having in mind both ant and maven , gradle has set of tasks those are **logically grouped into plugin**                                                                                                                                                  
 + android development tool also going to be gradle based instead eclipse plugin.  it has support to REUSE existing ant build script.                                                                                                                                
 + gradle adopt “configuration over convension” philosphy                                                                                                                                                                                                               
 + dependency support not only for external library, but other project also can be a dependency                                                                                                                                                                      
 + It’s not uncommon to face projects that use client-side languages like JavaScript that communicate with a mixed,  
    multilingual backend like Java, Groovy, and Scala, which in turn calls off to a C++ legacy application. 
 + It’s all about the right tool for the job
 + it support smart exclude for tasks , gradle can run as deamon process , when we do build often                                                                                                                                                                    
 + Each time you initiate a build, the JVM has to be started, Gradle’s dependencies have to be loaded into the class loader, and the project object model has to be constructed. This procedure usually takes a couple of seconds. Gradle daemon to the rescue       
 + Gradle ship with its own Groovy library

Lifecycle
=========

1. Initialization
2. Configuration
3. Execution

Different file
==============
1. build.gradle
2. gradle.properties
3. settings.gradle

Setup
=====     
 
+ **GRADLE\_HOME** , installation path of gradle. usaully unzipped directory
+ **GRADLE\_OPTS** , this environment variable used when jvm settings affect only for Gradle

Configuration block
===================

to configure sub-product that is multimodule project
