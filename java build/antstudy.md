| Ant doesnâ€™t give any guidance on how to structure your project. Though it allows for maximum flexibility, Ant makes each build script unique and hard to understand. External libraries required by your project were usually checked into version control, because there was no sophisticated mechanism to automatically pull them from a central location |                    |                  |
